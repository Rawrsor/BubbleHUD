//4Plug Support

This hud now has support for the mod manager 4Plug! You can get it here: http://www.teamfortress.tv/13401/4plug
This program allows you to customize (so far) the health (circle cross or numbers), the scoreboard, the winpanel, and the backpack color scheme.

//Color Customization

-In resource/clientscheme.res, change the RGB value of "AmmoInReserve". This changes most "accented" colors (ammo in reserve, some menu buttons, stickies etc)
